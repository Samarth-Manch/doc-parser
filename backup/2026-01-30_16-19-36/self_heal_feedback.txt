# Self-Healing Feedback

## Priority Fixes

### verify_output_file
- Verify that populated_schema.json contains rule extraction output
- Implementation: Check if file path is correct and contains formFillRules arrays

### run_rule_extraction
- Re-run rule extraction with proper configuration
- Implementation: Ensure orchestrator_rule_extraction.py completed all steps including formFillRules population

### check_schema_mapping
- Verify schema mapping between BUD fields and output format
- Implementation: Ensure field IDs and names are correctly mapped from BUD to output JSON

## Code Changes Needed

- Verify rule_extraction_agent.py is correctly populating formFillRules
- Check if schema.json template has formFillRules array defined
- Review orchestrator logs for errors or incomplete execution
- Validate that all required input files (BUD, schema) are present
