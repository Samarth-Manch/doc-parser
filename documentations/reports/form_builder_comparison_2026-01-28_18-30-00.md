---

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Review "Rule Check" Field**: The field "Rule Check" exists only in Form 2 (Vendor Creation Sample BUD 2). Determine if this field should be:
   - Added to Form 1 for consistency
   - Removed from Form 2 if it's not needed
   - Kept as an intentional difference between versions

2. **Version Naming**: Form 2 is named "Vendor Creation Sample BUD 2" while Form 1 is "Vendor Creation Sample BUD". This suggests Form 2 may be a newer version. Confirm if the "Rule Check" field is an intentional enhancement.

3. **Synchronization**: If both forms should be identical, add the "Rule Check" field to Form 1's "Withholding Tax Details" panel.
